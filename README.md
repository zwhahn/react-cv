# React CV

[Live Demo](https://zwhahn-react-cv.netlify.app/)

This is a web application built with React where users can input their information and generate a CV/ resume. The format is based off my own resume that I have been using for years. All pre-populated information is also my own to showcase what a filled in resume might look like. It is hosted on Netlify.

The application allows hyperlinks in the header and automatically adds a new blank bullet when entering Experience or Project description for a smooth user experience. The resume can be printed or downloaded.
